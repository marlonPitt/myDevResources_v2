# My Dev Resources version 1.2
This is a Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/pittMarlon/pen/XELzzd. The website is a simple website designed to replace my initial webpage. This one is mobile-responive, as well as having incorperated a small easter egg with the help of some Javascript. The color scheme has also been changed to be more appealing.
